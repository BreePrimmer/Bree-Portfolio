# Bree-Portfolio

## Description

I made this website to create a cool and fun portfolio showing off my coding projects! I wanted to make a nice looking website that holds all of my coding projects in a convient place. I want users to have an easy time accessing my projects. While making this website, I learned a lot! This is my most challenging HTML and CSS project so far. I had to learn how to use flexbox, that was probably the most difficult part. Learning how to use hover effects also was challenging for me. Another thing I spent a lot of time on was getting the background images to work and sizing them properly. Overall, I had a lot of fun designing this website, I thought it was an awesome project!

## Usage

To use this website, you can click the buttons in the navigation page at the top of the screen to jump to different sections of the website. You can read about me in the about me section, view my work in the "my work" section, and you can contact me at the bottom of the page. In the future, each work card should be clickable to bring you to the repository for that project. You can access my github page as well.

## Credits
I did most of my work on my own this time, I did not collaborate with classmates. However, I did use many resources to help when I got stuck.

Here are the image links. I had tried really hard to use images locally, but for some reason I am having problems getting files to work using local paths, so I had to use image urls. Here are the images I used.
